Introduction
============

We plan to explore manifold learning as presented in [@isomap] for a
lower dimensional embedding of images. Since lower dimensional hidden
representations allow for generative modeling, we also plan to explore
image generation by sampling from this lower dimensional manifold, an
idea quite in focus recently with the Generative Adversarial
Architectures [@gan].

Data Acquisition and Exploration
================================

There are a multitude of datasets for face images available on the web.
UMDFaces Dataset [@umdfaces] contains 367,888 face annotations for 8,277
subjects divided into 3 batches. It also includes human curated bounding
boxes for faces and also the estimated pose (yaw, pitch, and roll),
locations of twenty-one keypoints, and gender information generated by a
pre-trained neural network. There are other sources like [@facedata1],
which we may explore.

Data Exploitation
=================

We will begin with choosing an appropriate dataset from a plethora that
is already available. We will then detect keypoints followed by
generating descriptors around those keypoints using a suitable
algorithm. Once we obtain the feature vector representation for each
image, we will try to learn a parametrized manifold space. This
parametrization would not only help us in generating new faces along
that manifold, but a suitable choice of parameter may help us in
morphing specific features of individual faces.

Conclusion : Final Goal
=======================

Ideally we should be able to produce an interesting demonstration like
[@video]. However, subject to practicality constraints and plain old
luck, we might also be content with a survey of the field and a solid
indepth implementation of a fascinating application of network science!
